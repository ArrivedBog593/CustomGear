## Features

### Content Creation

- **Armor sets** with per-piece stats (durability, defense, toughness, knockback resistance)
- **Weapons** — swords, bows, crossbows, and shields with custom damage, durability, and charge speed
- **Tools** — pickaxes, axes, shovels, and hoes with mining speed, harvest tiers, and area-tilling
- **Food items** with nutrition, saturation, eating speed, and on-eating effects
- **Blocks** — including directional and gravity-affected, with per-face textures, light, sounds, and mining requirements
- **Fluids** with custom colors, contact effects, and burning behavior

### Effects & Gameplay

- Held effects, piece effects, and full-set bonuses
- **Mob drops** — any item can drop from mobs with configurable chance, count, and entity filters (hot-reloadable: balance your economy live)
- `fire_resistant` items that survive fire and lava, like netherite — works on items, food, gear, blocks, and buckets
- **Transparent armor** — armor with full stats and effects that draws nothing on the body
- **Damage resistances** — three layers of damage reduction by damage type, by attacker, or both combined (hot-reloadable)

### Textures & Models

- Reference vanilla/modded textures or provide your own PNG files
- Per-face block textures, bow-pulling animations, custom armor layers
- **3D armor models** via GeckoLib — use Blockbench models with optional animations instead of flat layers (optional dependency: without it, the armor falls back to 2D layers)

### Recipes & Tags

- **Native recipe system** — shaped, shapeless, smelting, blasting, and smithing, defined in JSON
- Recipe ingredients support **tags** (`"#minecraft:planks"` = any plank type, including items from other mods)
- Content can **belong to tags** via a `tags` field, so your items work in other mods' recipes

### Server & Multiplayer

- **Content packs** — distribute everything as a single `.zip` that players drop into `packs/`
- **Multiplayer content verification** — the server checks at login that clients have matching files, with configurable enforcement
- `/customgear reload` — update names, effects, recipes, and drops without restarting

### Quality of Life

- Full multi-language support per item
- Informative tooltips (effects, set bonuses, harvest levels, mob drops)
- Clear validation errors that name the file and the exact problem

## Compatibility

- Minecraft 26.2
- NeoForge 26.2.x
- Java 25
- JEI (optional, recommended) — recipes are fully visible
- GeckoLib (optional) — required only for 3D armor models
- Modded enchantments work automatically on enchantable items
- Models from any installed mod can be referenced with `reference` mode
- Ingredients from any installed mod can be used in recipes
- Multiplayer: server and clients must run the same mod version and matching content files (verified automatically at login)
